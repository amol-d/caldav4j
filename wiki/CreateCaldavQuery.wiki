#summary Here we discuss on a language to describe caldav query

= Introduction =

As CalDAVCollectionManager class is full of redundant code about creating tonns of different queries, we start discussing about a language to describe caldav query.

The target is about REPORT, PROPFIND and maybe MULTIGET methods, as CReate-Update-Delete methods works well enough in this implementation.


= Target =

Here we list some kind of calendar-query that should be done, in compliance of RFC4791

 # Query Components (VEVENT,VTODO) 
 * by time-range
 * selecting properties to retrieve (so you have to specify vcalendar.vevent)
 * filtering by component.property value

 # Query Components filtering for subcomponents properties
 * VTODO.VALARM.time-range=interval
 # third



= Results =

Here we write the query of the former paragraph in our new descriptive language
