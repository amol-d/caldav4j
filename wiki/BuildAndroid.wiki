Sudheer used caldav4j to write a caldav client for Android. To use that client, which is based on default Android package, you have to follow these steps:
 # checkout android sources v 2.2
 # build android from scratch
 # replace the Calendar android sources with the one provided by Sudheet
 # build again
 # get the Calendar.apk
 # install it on your emulator

 after getting android sources, you need to apply this patch to build on 32 bit arch.

Building requires about 10Gb disk space and a couple of hours on my Core2Duo laptop
