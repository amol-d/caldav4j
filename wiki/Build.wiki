#summary More info on building CalDAV4j

== Get Java 1.6 ==

Caldav4j requires Java 1.6

== Get Maven 2.x ==

[http://maven.apache.org/download.html Download] and install the latest version of the Maven build tool.

== Get the source ==

Checkout the CalDAV4j [http://code.google.com/p/caldav4j/source source] code.

== Build without Tests ==

From within the source tree run:
{{{
mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true package
}}}

== Build With Tests ==

The reason I mentioned building without the tests first is because building with the tests is harder than it should be right now, but if you are developing CalDAV4j you should really be running the tests.

   # Get a caldav server (Bedework, Chandler Server, ..)
      * [http://chandlerproject.org/Developers/DownloadChandlerServer Download] and install Chandler Server (aka Cosmo)
      * [http://www.bedework.org Download] and install Bedework
   # Create The Test User 
      * After starting the server, create a user on the server called "test" with a password of "password"
   # modify the CaldavCredential.java putting your server credential and uris.
      * chandler: http://localhost:8080/chandler/dav
      * bedewor: http://localhost:8080/ucaldav/user
   # Build 
{{{
mvn package
}}}

The so-called unit tests are really functional tests - they require the a running CalDAV server to test against. 

Making CalDAV4j run and be tested against ANY CalDAV compliant server is a priority for the project.

== Troubleshooting ==
 # missing GCaldavCredential

 # missing resources while building

== Building with Eclipse ==
 TODO: pls provide a quick tour on
  * add caldav4j repository on eclipse (subversion integration) link video or snapshots
  * checkout caldav4j
  * enable maven
  * verify all required source folders
