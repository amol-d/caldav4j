== CalDAV4j Overview ==


CalDAV4j is a protocol library that extends the Slide project's [http://jakarta.apache.org/slide/webdav-client.html WebDAV client library] (which itself is an extension of the Apache's [http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/httpclient/ HttpClient] library) to allow high level manipulation of CalDAV calendar collections as well as lower level CalDAV protocol interactions.

== Goals ==

   * A high level API: This API works at the level of ical4j objects, and allows for high level operations like querying for events in a given date range, and updating master events and recurrence instances. All the "hard" protocol work that you need to do to make this happen is hidden from the end user.

   * A lower level protocol API: Let's you work at the Http/WebDAV/CalDAV protocol level by creating instances of !HttpMethods (like !GetMethod, !MkCalendar, !ReportMethod) and executing them. 

   * Performance: When possible caches (such as caches of etags and icalendar resources) are maintained so that network chatter and parsing of icalender files is minimized.

   * Compliance: We aim to be implement the entire [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4791.txt CalDAV spec] as well as the [http://www.sharemation.com/~milele/public/dav/draft-ito-dav-ticket-00.txt WebDAV tickets spec]. 

== Status ==
