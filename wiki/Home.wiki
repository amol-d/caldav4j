== CalDAV4j Overview ==

---

CalDAV4j is a protocol library that extends the Slide project's [[http://jakarta.apache.org/slide/webdav-client.html][WebDAV client library]] (which itself is an extension of the Apache's [[http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/httpclient/][HttpClient]] library) to allow high level manipulation of CalDAV calendar collections as well as lower level CalDAV protocol interactions.

The impetus for this project is Scooby's need for a CalDAV library to communicate with Cosmo. 

== Goals ==

   * A high level API: This API works at the level of ical4j objects, and allows for high level operations like querying for events in a given date range, and updating master events and recurrence instances. All the "hard" protocol work that you need to do to make this happen is hidden from the end user.

   * A lower level protocol API: Let's you work at the Http/WebDAV/CalDAV protocol level by creating instances of !HttpMethods (like !GetMethod, !MkCalendar, !ReportMethod) and executing them. 

   * Performance: When possible caches (such as caches of etags and icalendar resources) are maintained so that network chatter and parsing of icalender files is minimized.

   * Compliance: We aim to be implement the entire [[http://ietfreport.isoc.org/idref/draft-dusseault-caldav/][CalDAV spec]] as well as the [[http://www.sharemation.com/~milele/public/dav/draft-ito-dav-ticket-00.txt][WebDAV tickets spec]]. 

== Status ==

CalDAV4j 0.2 is the current release.

The 0.1 release features include:
   * Support for <calendar-query> reports
   * Protocol level support for MKCALENDAR, GET, REPORT, PUT 
   * High level API for accessing events within a calendar collection
   * Caching of CalDAV resources

Among the things not supported yet are:
   * Free Busy reports
   * High level API for accessing anything other than VEVENTS (like VTODO's for example)
   * Ticket support

== Documentation ==

Here is a [[Documentation.CalDAV4jTutorial][tutorial]] to get you started using CalDAV4j.

The code is also fairly well !JavaDoc'd.
